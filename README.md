# Upon-A-Star---NASA-Space-Apps
An educational game on variable stars for the NASA Space Apps Challenge

The main file "uponastar.py" is the main file which should be run in order to run the game. 
All files, images, fonts and "menu.py" should all be stored together in the same folder as "uponastar.py"

Thank you !
